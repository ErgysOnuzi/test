Based on my analysis of your website, let me create the comprehensive checklists you requested to identify any functional issues and deployment blockers.

📋 CHECKLIST #1: Website Functionality Issues
🔍 Core Functionality Check:
✅ Next.js Server: Running successfully on port 5000
✅ Page Routing: All locale routes working ([locale]/menu, [locale]/gallery, etc.)
✅ API Endpoints: 17 API routes detected and compiling
⚠️ Cross-Origin Warning: Next.js flagging future allowedDevOrigins requirement
✅ No LSP Errors: TypeScript compilation clean
✅ Internationalization: German/English locales functioning
🎨 Frontend Components Check:
✅ UI Components: Complete shadcn/ui component library (30+ components)
✅ Layout Components: Header, Footer, Hero, GlobalLoader present
✅ Specialty Components: Instagram feeds, gallery, menu filters, forms
✅ Admin Dashboard: Complete CRUD functionality components present
❓ Instagram Integration: Need to verify API connectivity and embed functionality
❓ Google Reviews: API endpoint exists, need to verify data retrieval
🔧 Backend Functionality Check:
✅ Database Schema: Complete Drizzle ORM setup
✅ Authentication: Admin auth system implemented
✅ File Uploads: Image upload endpoints configured
❓ Email Integration: Replit mail integration added, need to verify contact form
❓ Database Operations: CRUD operations present, need runtime testing
📋 CHECKLIST #2: Deployment Blockers
🏗️ Build Configuration Issues:
✅ Production Build: Successfully compiles all 37 routes
✅ NODE_ENV: Now properly set to production in scripts
✅ Html Components: No illegal Html component imports found
✅ Static Generation: 20 static pages generating successfully
⚠️ Next.js Warning: Cross-origin configuration needed for future versions
🔧 Deployment Configuration:
✅ Deployment Target: Set to autoscale
✅ Build Command: npm run build configured
✅ Start Command: npm start configured
⚠️ Multiple Workflows: Duplicate Server workflows in .replit file
❓ Environment Variables: Need to verify all secrets are properly set for production
⚡ Performance & Optimization:
✅ Webpack Optimization: Custom chunk splitting configured
✅ Production Optimizations: Compression and console removal active
✅ Image Optimization: Next.js image domains configured for Replit
❓ Database Connection: Need to verify PostgreSQL connection in production
📋 MASTER COMBINED CHECKLIST
🚨 HIGH PRIORITY - Must Fix Before Publishing:
⚠️ Cross-Origin Configuration

Add allowedDevOrigins to next.config.mjs for future Next.js compatibility
Status: Warning that will become error in future versions
🔧 Environment Variables Verification

Verify all production secrets are set (DATABASE_URL, API keys)
Test database connectivity in production environment
Status: Critical for functionality
📱 Runtime Functionality Testing

Test contact form email delivery
Verify Instagram feed data loading
Test Google Reviews API response
Validate admin dashboard CRUD operations
Status: Need user testing to confirm
🔶 MEDIUM PRIORITY - Recommended Fixes:
⚙️ Cleanup Configuration

Remove duplicate Server workflows from .replit file
Status: Configuration optimization
🎯 Performance Validation

Test site loading speed after deployment
Verify image optimization is working
Status: Post-deployment verification needed
✅ RESOLVED ISSUES:
✅ Html component import errors (FIXED)
✅ NODE_ENV production configuration (FIXED)
✅ Build compilation errors (FIXED)
✅ TypeScript/LSP errors (CLEAN)
✅ Next.js App Router architecture (CLEAN)
🎯 IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN:
Before Publishing:

Fix cross-origin configuration warning
Verify environment variables are set for production
Test core functionality (contact form, admin login)
After Publishing:
4. Verify all API endpoints work in production

Test Instagram and Google Reviews data loading
Clean up duplicate workflow configurations
Critical Assessment: Your website has no major blockers preventing publication. The main issues are configuration optimizations and runtime verification needs that should be tested post-deployment.
