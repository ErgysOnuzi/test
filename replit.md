## Overview

La Cantina Berlin is a full-stack restaurant website built with modern web technologies. It's designed for an authentic Italian restaurant in Berlin, featuring a sophisticated UI with warm terracotta and cream color schemes. The application provides a complete restaurant management system including menu display, reservations, gallery, events, and contact functionality.

**IMPORTANT**: All fake/mock data has been removed from the website. Components now return empty arrays or hide themselves when no real data is available, ensuring only authentic business information is displayed.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
